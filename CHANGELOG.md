## 5.0.0 (2021-04-14)

This release brings `versions` in line with version `2.0.0` of the SemVer spec.
The main addition to the spec is the allowance of hyphens in both the prerelease
and metadata sections. As such, **certain versions like `1.2.3+1-1` which
previously would not parse as SemVer now do.**

To accomodate this and other small spec updates, the `SemVer` and `Version`
types have received breaking changes here.

#### Changed

- **Breaking:** The `_svMeta` field of `SemVer` is now parsed as a dumber `Maybe Text` instead of `[VChunk]`, due to metadata now being allowed to possess
  leading zeroes.
- **Breaking:** Like the above, the `_vMeta` field of `Version` is now `Maybe Text`.
- **Breaking: The `_vRel` and `_vMeta` fields of `Version` have had their order
  flipped.** Further, the prelease and meta sections are now expected in the
  same order as `SemVer` when parsing (prerel first, meta second). `Version` is
  thus now a quite similar to `SemVer`, except allowing letters in more
  permissive positions.
- **Breaking:** The `meta` traversal has been altered to accomodate the metadata
  field changes.

#### Fixed

- Parsing certain legal SemVers specified in the spec.

## 4.0.3 (2021-02-23)

#### Changed

- Support for GHC 9.

## 4.0.2 (2021-01-23)

#### Fixed

- A bug in zero parsing within SemVer prereleases. [#42]

## 4.0.1 (2020-10-22)

#### Fixed

- An infinite loop in `Version` comparison. [aura#652]

## 4.0.0 (2020-10-20)

#### Changed

- **Breaking:** `VChunk` now cannot be empty.
- **Breaking:** A `Version` now guarantees `NonEmpty` chunks.
- **Breaking:** A `Mess` now guarantees `NonEmpty` chunks, and its structure has
  been significantly changed. Particularly, `Mess` values are now aware of the
  `Int` values they hold (when they do), as well as "revision" values of the
  pattern `rXYZ`.
- Comparison of `Version` values is more memory efficient.

#### Added

- `Version` now has an extra field, `_vMeta :: [VChunk]` for capturing
  "metadata" like Semver. This prevents otherwise nice-looking versions from
  being demoted to `Mess`.
- The `MChunk` type to accomodate the changes to `Mess` mentioned above.

#### Removed

- **Breaking:** `Version` no longer has a `Monoid` instance.

#### Fixed

- `""` no longer parses in any way. [#32]
- Version strings with trailing whitespace no longer parse via `versioning`. [#33]
- Particular edge cases involving `Mess` comparisons. [aura#646]
- A particular edge case involving prereleases in `Version` comparisons. [aura#586]

## 3.5.4 (2020-05-12)

#### Added

- The functions `isIdeal`, `isGeneral`, and `isComplex` for `Bool`-based
  inspection of parse results.
- `messMajor`, `messMinor`, `messPatch`, and `messPatchChunk` for improved
  introspection into `Mess` values.

#### Changed

- Improved `Mess` comparison logic.

## 3.5.3

- GHC 8.10 support.

## 3.5.2

- Added a new `PVP` type and parsers.

## 3.5.1.1

- GHC 8.8 compatibility.

## 3.5.0

- Updated to `megaparsec-7`. Our `ParsingError` type alias has changed to match
  Megaparsec's new error model, and `errorBundlePretty` is now exposed instead of
  the old `parseErrorPretty`.

## 3.4.0.1

- Enhanced the whitespace handling in `semver'`, `version'`, and `mess'`.

## 3.4.0

- Removed `ParseV` and surrounding machinery.
  Use `versioning` now instead of the `parseV` function.

## 3.3.2

- GHC 8.4.1 compatibility.

## 3.3.0

- New `Semantic` typeclass that provides Traversals for SemVer-like data out
  of all the version types. `Text` was also given an instance, so its much
  easier to manipulate directly:

```
Î» "1.2.3" & minor %~ (+ 1)
"1.3.3"
```

Some Lenses and Traversals had their names changed or were removed entirely
to accomodate this new typeclass.

- `SemVer` and `Version` should never contain negative values, so their numeric
  components were changed from `Int` to `Word`.

## 3.2.0

- Updated for `megaparsec-6` and GHC 8.2.

## 3.1.1

- Added instances for common typeclasses: `Generic`, `NFData`, and
  `Hashable`. This is to avoid having users define these instances themselves
  as orphans. If there are more instances you want added, please let me know.
  `Data` was left out on purpose.

## 3.1.0

- Added support for _epoch_ numbers in the `Version` type. These are numbers
  like the `1:` in `1:2.3.4`. These are used in Arch Linux in rare cases where
  packages change their versioning scheme, but need a reliable integer prefix
  to establish ordering. The `Version` type has been given a new field,
  `_vEpoch :: Maybe Int`, and a corresponding lens, `vEpoch`.

## 3.0.2

- Expose internal parsers so that they could be used in other parser programs
  that parse version numbers in larger files.

## 3.0.0

- Updated for `megaparsec-5` and `ghc-8`

## 2.0.0

- Switched to `megaparsec` to perform all parsing as `Text`
- Support for legacy `String` removed
- Added more Traversals and INLINE'd all Lenses/Traversals

## 1.1.0

- Added Lenses and Traversals (no `lens` dependency)
